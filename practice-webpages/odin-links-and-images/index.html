        <!-- rel="noopener noreferer" is for security, for example jumping to a new page through a link is like a opening a new door and when there is no "noopener noreferer" people can see what is behind my door (refer) and even access it (open)-->

        Notes for linking documents:
            - Internal paths (inside layers): If the document is within the same project layers, write the path from your current file. For example, if your file is in project/ and the image is in project/images/image2.png, reference it as images/image2.png.
            - External paths (outside layers): Use "../" to go up one layer, then specify the folder path from there (similar to the first note). For example, ../parent-folder/images/image2.png.
