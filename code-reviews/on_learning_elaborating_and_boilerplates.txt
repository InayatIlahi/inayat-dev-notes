### Elaboration for learning.

Suppose I'm reading a peice 100 charecter text, whenver after reading it I feel "I get it" and it nothing unique, it maybe indication I didn't understood it with enough dept.
For example when I was reading and used the inbuild feature of firefox DE to explain me what I thought I understood I already, after the explanation that same thing felt more unique to me.

So through this I conclude, whenever a concept in a text is read for the first time for the purpose of learning, and it find to be nothing interesting or new it is a probable indication it is understood with enough dept.

### Boilerplates

I thought Boilerplates are same pre-build templates, but they ain't.
I consider myself a hater (not voilent) of prebuild tempalates, cause I feel the urge to be unique not following what other created for me (though I think it is narcissism), and before coming a hater of boilerplates, I understood they're different.

However how are they different actually? (I assume they're inaccurate formal distinctions) Boilerplates are hard to vary templates you build other things upon, like langauge and note talking app, a prebuild template is a you being given structure to speak through and write note through.

what is hard to vary? works till an very large extent without need to change, they are so large that creating your own is inefficient, though not necessarily useless.
