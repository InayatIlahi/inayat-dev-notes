        <h1>On Understanding by Making Sense</h1>
        <h3>The Habit of shallow learning</h3>
            <p>In school <em>(though I'm still there)</em>, I used to get a syllabus to learn from. The teacher's objective was to <strong>complete the syllabus</strong>
                And because they only get 45 minutes in a day, they used to prioritize completion over depth <em>(though a good majority of teachers don't understand what they're teaching till a good depth)</em>.
            </p>
            <p>This used to force me to memorize facts without actually making their sense (it takes time to make sense of things), ultimately leading to lack of interest.</p>
        <h3>To Understand not memorize</h3>
            <p>This observation tells me understanding is making sense of things. If there is a attribute like href="", I can make sense of it by knowing it is an acronym for hypertext reference = "its address."</p>
            <p>However, it's to be noted I could make sense of it only when <em>I was familiar with the concepts it was based on</em>. If I didn't know what hypertext and reference were, I'd not make sense.</p>
            <p>To really do it, I'd need to familiarize myself with it, which is not hard and can be done by understanding the individual concepts, either directly <em>(if you're familiar with the individual concept based on)</em> or indirectly <em>(by breaking that individual concept down until you find a piece you can start to make sense from)</em>.</p>
